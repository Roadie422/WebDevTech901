                    <p>My greatest sense of fullfillment comes from new and novel challenges. As I learn new skills and grow in knowledge, I gain personal satifaction and a sense confidence in myself and skills. 
                    As a result, I have a very diverse background in creative fields, technical areas and customer facing professions. 
                        I am very excited to take this course to continue to add new skills and knowledge, allowing me the chance to get a professional job in a more dynamic environment.
                        I do well with project based challenges and work well with others to solve problems. I have a strong background in creative design with an art degree in painting and photography and hope to be able to use these skills in web development as well.
